# @deepseek-ai/dsh-tui

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The interactive terminal front door for DeepSeek Harness agents, built on [`@deepseek-ai/tui`](../../../vendor/tui/README.md) — this repository's vendored `pi-tui`, whose editor carries the prompt-prefix and frameless modifications this front door renders with. It requires stdin and stdout TTYs; scripts and Loader pipes should use the one-shot [`@deepseek-ai/dsh-headless`](../../bundle/headless/README.md) app instead.

The implemented [TUI feature Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/archived/feature/2026-07-17-dedicated-full-screen-tui-front-door.md) owns the front-door decision; the [file-reference autocomplete Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/archived/feature/2026-07-23-tui-file-reference-autocomplete.md) owns path-only `@file` behavior; the [terminal-state snapshot Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/archived/testing/2026-07-18-tui-terminal-state-snapshots.md) owns its verification strategy.

Interactive terminals on macOS, Linux, and Windows are supported. Windows uses pi-tui's native console VT-input handling, and the [Windows support Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/archived/feature/2026-07-20-windows-tui-support.md) owns the platform decision and ConPTY process verification.

This package owns interactive terminal presentation and input only. It injects `agents`, [`commands`](../../interaction/commands/README.md), `llm`, `systemPrompt`, `tokenMeter`, `tools`, and `userQuestions`, optionally reads a `skills` service (present only when one is mounted), then drives an agent created or resumed by app or developer code. Agent lifecycle, persistence, and the model-facing [`ask_user_question`](../../interaction/tool-ask-user/README.md) tool remain separate composition entries.

After terminal startup succeeds, the package provides the terminal-local `ctx.tui` extension service. A plugin that injects it can call `openOverlay()` with a component factory and constrained layout options; the host exposes the viewport, semantic theme (including terminal-safe DeepSeek `brand` treatment), display-text escaping, redraw, close, and a lifetime signal, but not the pi-tui tree, terminal, focus controller, or overlay handle. Plugin overlays, the model selector, and user questions share one FIFO modal queue. Each request is an effect of the calling plugin fiber, so unload removes queued work or closes visible work before cleanup settles; terminal shutdown unloads dependents before stopping pi-tui. Overlay state is not logged or replayed. Component code is trusted and may render ANSI styling, but must pass untrusted text through `host.display()`. The [interactive-extension Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/archived/architecture/2026-07-22-tui-interactive-extension-service.md) owns the boundary and rejected alternatives.

The TUI rebuilds resumed history from the append-origin session events, renders Markdown responses and reasoning, applies each tool's `presentCall` / `presentResult` intent to terminal, diff, or generic cards, keeps the standing `todo/write` plan above the editor (cleared on the next `turn/start`), and presents `ctx.userQuestions` questions inline between the transcript/status area and the editor. The question panel shows progress, numbered options, wrapped labels, and separately indented descriptions; it obeys both `maxQuestionOptions` and `questionDialogMaxHeight`, marks hidden options with `↑ N more` / `↓ N more`, and uses Page Up / Page Down to page long question/detail content before an individually oversized selected block while keeping the editor visible. The latest logged session title becomes the header subtitle, with `welcome` before a title exists, and the terminal window title becomes `<session title> — <configured title>`. A durable `llm/retry` event retracts the failed step's live chunks and renders the scheduled retry count, delay, and failure in the transcript; success, exhaustion, and cancellation then settle through ordinary session events. The footer totals each logged model step's usage once, including failed attempts, while treating committed-message usage as a fallback for logs without a usage chunk. Its idle view compares token-meter pressure with `ctx.llm.resolveModelInfo()` context for the current route, displays `context unknown` when the adapter has no capacity metadata, and also shows tool-card mode plus the current model and any explicitly selected reasoning effort; while the agent runs, an elapsed working indicator and `esc interrupt` replace that summary. A surface replacement never rewrites the rendered transcript: the conversation it shadows stays readable, and a landed compaction checkpoint adds one dim `… earlier context was compacted …` marker at its log position, so the terminal reports where the model stopped seeing that history instead of erasing it. Model-only replacement copies — a pruned tool result, a regenerated assistant message — render nothing.

An embedding may provide `TuiRuntime.formatCwd` when its logical workspace label differs from the session's host directory. The override changes only the footer label; tools continue to use the session `cwd`.

Before model output, session events, tool presenters, questions, configuration, or diagnostics reach pi-tui's ANSI-aware renderers or the terminal title, the TUI renders C0 and C1 controls other than line feeds as visible `\xNN` text. Those sources cannot add terminal control sequences; the TUI and pi-tui retain ownership of terminal rendering and styling.

Typing `@` at a token boundary searches files and directories under the session working directory. A bare fuzzy query uses a reusable bounded workspace index; a query containing `/` lists that directory directly, and selecting a folder keeps completion open for descent. Whitespace-bearing paths are inserted as `@"path with spaces"`. Selecting a file inserts only its path and a trailing space: the TUI does not read it, attach hidden context, or replace it with a reference object. When a model-facing `read` tool is registered, the TUI adds one fixed system-prompt instruction telling the model to read an explicit path when its contents are needed.

When optional `ctx.sessionReferenceResolver` is mounted, the same `@` menu also offers metadata-only session candidates, inserts `@[label](dsh-session:<payload>)`, and prepares the selected snapshots before dispatch. Session references remain structured because the model has no filesystem-like tool for retrieving session snapshots later. Preparation disables duplicate submission and restores the editor input on failure. The TUI chooses `agent.steer()` or `agent.followup()` from the status after that asynchronous preparation, so idle follow-ups still dispatch `agent/pre-step` while in-turn steering joins at a checkpoint without that hook.

While the agent is running, ordinary editor submissions call `agent.steer()`; otherwise they call `agent.followup()`. A slash at the start of the submitted line enters `ctx.commands` instead: known commands execute directly, unknown commands produce a warning, and neither path automatically reaches the model. A command producer may explicitly schedule agent work; [`dsh-plan-mode`](../../plan/plan-mode/README.md) uses that contract for `/plan [message]`. The TUI registers `/help`, `/model`, `/clear`, `/details`, `/palette`, `/reload`, `/resume`, `/status`, and `/exit` as agent-scoped definitions; every other effective command joins autocomplete and `/help` dynamically, as do `/skill:` completions. A status line above the editor reports the turn phase the TUI derives from session events — waiting for the first token, thinking, responding, or executing tools — with the elapsed time in that phase and the running step total, refreshed each second, and ends with the `Enter sends steering, Esc cancels` hint; while steering messages wait to reach the model it inserts a `N queued ·` badge before the hint that clears as each drains. During a live standalone compaction bracket, a fixed `Context being compacted <elapsed>` row appears above the prompt, the idle prompt caret becomes a one-cell throbbing `⊙`, and terminal progress stays active until close; the row and glyph share the bracket's one refresh timer. This live state is never reconstructed from the log; a failed close adds `Compaction failed: <error>` to the transcript, while a resumed orphaned start never activates the indicator ([decision](../../../.agents/notes/archived/feature/2026-07-30-compaction-progress-visibility.md)). Ctrl+C or Escape cancels a running turn. Tool and injected-context cards collapse long bodies into a configurable head/tail preview; Ctrl+O cycles tool cards through collapsed preview, full output, and hidden — the hidden phase drops tool cards from the transcript entirely while context cards stay at their preview, since injected instructions are not tool traffic. The hidden phase also folds each turn's assistant steps into one message: the first step with visible text or reasoning keeps the turn's single `Assistant` header, later steps render as headerless continuations, and a step without a visible body renders nothing; leaving the hidden phase restores the per-step headers. An injected-context card renders its message as prose with the producer's outer reminder frame stripped, so neither the fold nor the frame stripping depends on the payload's syntax. Ctrl+R toggles reasoning, Ctrl+L redraws, and Ctrl+D exits while idle. `/details` names the same state those two shortcuts cycle: bare it opens a centered keyboard toggle with one entry per dimension — `Tool cards` and `Reasoning` — showing the live values, where Tab cycles the highlighted entry and applies the change immediately (the transcript behind the dialog is the preview), and Enter, Esc, or Ctrl+C closes; `/details collapsed|expanded|hidden` jumps tool cards to that phase directly, and `/details reasoning [on|off]` sets — or bare `reasoning` toggles — reasoning-block display; arguments combine in one invocation, an unknown argument fails with the usage line, and a combined invocation applies reasoning first so its transcript rebuild never drops the card notice.

`/model` opens the advisory `ctx.llm` catalog as a keyboard selector: a filter box above the list narrows rows by a case-insensitive substring over each row's `provider/model` label, model name, and description, keeping the highlighted row selected when it survives the filter; Up/Down moves, Shift+Tab cycles the focused model's adapter-advertised reasoning efforts in display order, Enter selects the model and effort, and Escape clears a non-empty filter before a second Escape closes it. When an adapter does not advertise a default effort, the cycle also includes `Default`, which clears an explicit selection and preserves the provider default; models without selectable effort metadata ignore Shift+Tab. The selector renders the exact advertised effort list—including `off` when present—and does not synthesize, clamp, or transfer an effort between models. `/model <model>` still selects an unambiguous model id directly, while `/model <provider>/<model>` selects an exact target and uses its adapter default when one exists. The configured target or latest logged request header initializes the selector, and an unlisted current model remains visible because catalogs are advisory. Selection is local to this TUI session. Prompt assembly snapshots the target for one step, replaces `{{provider}}` and `{{model}}`, and applies the same provider/model/reasoning-effort target through `agent/request`; a switch during assembly therefore starts with a later step. The request header durably records targets that reach the model, while an unused selection remains process-local.

`/reload` (EXPERIMENTAL, dev-only) re-reads every file-backed loader config tree and applies the diff to the running app — the HMR watcher's config path, invoked manually; it needs the cordis Loader in the context and degrades to a warning without one, runs only while the agent is idle, and refuses re-entry while a reload is in flight. Module-source hot reload remains watcher-owned. When a `skills` service is mounted, `/skill:<name> [instructions]` loads that skill's instructions into the conversation as a user turn; autocomplete lists user-invocable skills, and exact invocation rejects a skill whose user policy disables it.

The footer sums the session's reported usage as `↑<uncached input> ↓<output>`, followed by `cache <rate>%` once any input has been billed — the share of billed prompt tokens (uncached input plus cache reads and writes) served from the provider cache, rounded to a percent. It also compares token-meter pressure with `ctx.llm.resolveModelInfo()` context for the current route (omitting the context share when the adapter has no capacity metadata) and shows the current model and tool-card mode; the right side clips first when the footer is narrow.

`/status` adds a point-in-time diagnostics card to the transcript and remains available while the agent runs. It reports the session id, title, working directory, selected provider/model, selected reasoning effort or default behavior, reasoning-block visibility, agent state, event/turn/step/tool-call counts, exact input/output/cache token buckets, KV-cache hit rate, token-meter context use and capacity, creation time, and latest event time. Missing titles, models, cache input, or context capacity are labeled instead of inferred. The card is terminal-only and does not duplicate the compact footer.

`/resume` opens a full-viewport keyboard selector instead of a centered dialog. The selector opens as soon as the command runs and takes input focus while the session scan is still pending, showing a loading placeholder until the rows arrive; Escape cancels an in-flight scan the same way it cancels the loaded list. Two scopes cover the same candidate set: the current workspace, which it opens on, and all workspaces, which Tab toggles to. The scope line under the search field names the active scope and the count the other holds, and each row in the all-workspaces scope also reports its own workspace. Toggling clears the search and selection so the highlighted row always belongs to the visible list.

Its focused search field starts immediately after the search glyph and emits pi-tui's cursor marker, so terminal IME composition remains anchored inside the field. Rows read no whole logs: when the optional projection cache is mounted, titles come from the live projection registry or the durable checkpoint row, with a cold read folding only the log tail since the checkpoint (written back so the next scan is zero-I/O, bounded by `resumeScanConcurrency`); a composition without the cache falls back to one bounded batch title read over the logs. Candidates are sorted by metadata activity — a live session's last in-memory event time, otherwise the persisted artifact's mtime, falling back to creation time — and searchable by title or session id, and by workspace label in the all-workspaces scope; each row reports that timestamp plus current/live/persisted state and the id. Up/Down and Page Up/Page Down navigate, Enter resumes, Escape clears a non-empty search before a second Escape cancels, and Ctrl+C cancels directly. The current session, a session already live in this runtime, an unreadable log, or a session with no recorded workspace to run in remains visible but disabled; a workspace other than the current one is a scope rather than a disabled reason, because resume enters that directory.

Selection repeats those checks, fully reads and replay-validates the one chosen log, rejects it when its logged provider has no current adapter, and requires the current agent to be idle before flushing the current session. The TUI then stops the terminal UI and calls the optional host-owned `TuiRuntime.handoffResume` with the selected id and the workspace re-read at preflight: process cwd, not the restored session header, is what filesystem and shell tools resolve against, so the host must enter that directory. Where `process.execve` is available, the shipped `dsh` host chdirs into it before disposing the app and replacing its process, and rejects an unreachable directory while the terminal can still be restored. Resume restores the same `SessionId`, transcript, title, todos, and durable goal; goal activation remains disarmed and the TUI asks for human confirmation or `/goal resume`.

The exit line is launcher-owned, not configurable. A launcher provides `TUI_GOODBYE_MESSAGE_KEY` on the boot context — for the shipped `dsh`, the command that resumes this session — and exiting prints it verbatim after the terminal is released; absent, exiting prints nothing. Only the launcher knows how it was invoked, so only it can name a command that works. The TUI escapes terminal controls before rendering and never executes the text. A launcher that also supplies `MAIN_SESSION_ID_KEY` fixes which session the mounted app binds to, so resume survives any config-level patch.

A launcher can seed a fresh session's first turn by providing `INITIAL_SKILL_KEY` (the skill name) on the boot context; the TUI auto-invokes it exactly as a typed `/skill:<name>`, once the chat is live. The shipped `dsh migrate`/`dsh upgrade` set it and only for a fresh session, so a resumed session never re-invokes the skill; an unknown name is reported as a notice.

```yaml
- id: terminal
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-tui'
  config:
    welcome: 'Coding agent ready.'
    sessionId: main-session-123

```

Startup fails before mounting when either process stream is not a TTY. The composing app must mount the TUI before its config-created agent so the front door can observe `agent-loop/config-start-failed`; a matching exact-session failure is written before fullscreen mode starts and exits with status 1 instead of leaving a blank terminal. Disposal stops extension admission, unloads the `ctx.tui` provider and its dependent plugins, aborts running commands, removes the TUI definitions, stops loaders, rejects pending questions, drains terminal input, restores terminal state, unregisters event listeners and the user-interaction provider, and never exits a replacement process during HMR. A user exit disposes the application root so sibling resources close, then exits; a five-second fallback prevents one stuck disposer from trapping the process.

## Color

Every general-purpose SGR code the TUI emits lives in one table, `paletteSpec` in `components/theme.ts`, which `createPalette` derives its wrappers from and `/palette` prints; no component writes an escape of its own. The table holds only the standard 16-color ANSI foregrounds and SGR attributes, which every terminal remaps to its active color scheme, so the TUI stays readable on light and dark backgrounds alike. The startup banner gradient and the official mark's exact `#4D6BFE` ink are the two deliberate truecolor brand exceptions. Body text keeps the terminal's default foreground rather than a fixed shade.

There is one role per visual meaning: `dim` is the single recessed tone, `accent` the single interaction emphasis, and `brand` the DeepSeek mark's standard-ANSI fallback, while `success` and `error` double as a diff's added and removed lines. Colors and attributes are separately typed, so `bold(accent(x))` compiles and `accent(error(x))` does not — SGR has no color stack, so nesting one color inside another silently drops the outer color at the inner one's close. Attributes occupy independent SGR groups and compose with any color in either order. Run `/palette` to see every role as your terminal renders it, with its SGR pair.

Grouped regions (user prompts, assistant replies, tool cards) are separated by a bold, underlined role header in the role color and blank-line spacing rather than a filled block or a per-line prefix, so a mouse drag-select copies the message text without any leading bar or indent; a tool card's status (pending, error, success) shows in its colored, underlined title glyph and title. Inside a tool card, the whole body — presenter title, a terminal `$` command and cwd, and the tool's own output — renders in one dim tone, so only the status-colored header carries color and the body reads as one recessed block instead of a run of competing shades; an injected-context card's prose is the same tone as its header. A diff card with both sides available colors and counts exact added `+` and removed `-` lines, while unchanged context stays dim and uncounted. If exact comparison exceeds `maxDiffEditLength`, the card renders each old-side row as removed and each new-side row as added, marks the footer approximate, and caches that fallback for later redraws. When `oldText` is unavailable, including pending writes and replay fallbacks as well as creates, every non-empty new-side row is shown and counted as added; that count does not prove the rows were absent from an existing file. Empty new content produces no synthetic `+ ` row. A `[signal …]` marker remains colored because there the color is the meaning rather than emphasis. The question panel emphasizes its active row with bold accent text, while selectors use reverse video. These treatments are foreground-only, so they never collide with the terminal background. Set `color: false` to strip all styling.

## Model Experience

### Interactive prompt input

#### What the model sees

Each non-empty ordinary editor submission becomes one text block, sent with `agent.followup()` while the target agent is idle and `agent.steer()` while it is running. A session mention becomes readable `@label` text plus the durable untrusted context defined by [`dsh-session-reference`](../../context/session-reference/README.md); its full JSON is hidden behind a compact reference card. Slash commands and keybindings are TUI-only; command results remain terminal notices. A command producer may schedule a separate agent input, such as the optional message accepted by `/plan [message]`.

#### Token effect

Submitted text is retained under the agent loop's normal session-history and compaction rules. Headers, the logged title, cards, Markdown rendering, status lines, plans, and help text add no tokens.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

### File-reference autocomplete

#### What the model sees

A selected file remains ordinary user text such as `@src/index.ts` or `@"docs/design notes.md"`; autocomplete adds no content block, durable context, or special reference payload. When `read` is registered, every request from this TUI agent also contains the following fixed system-prompt section. The model decides whether the task requires the file contents and calls `read` through the normal tool loop when it does; a path alone is not evidence that the file was inspected.

##### Exact system-prompt text

```markdown
Paths prefixed with @ are files explicitly referenced by the user. Use the read tool when their contents are needed; do not claim to have inspected a file before reading it.
```

#### Token effect

Autocomplete itself adds no tokens. The selected path contributes only its ordinary user-text tokens; the fixed instruction contributes system-prompt tokens whenever `read` is available. File contents consume context only after a model-selected `read` call returns them.

#### KV Cache effect

The fixed instruction is part of the stable system-prompt prefix and is reusable across turns. Each selected path is append-only user text; a later `read` result appends the requested contents through the ordinary tool transcript.

### Session model selection

#### What the model sees

The `/model` command text and keyboard-selector input are not logged or sent. New steps receive the selected provider/model route in prompt variables and the selected provider/model/reasoning-effort target in request routing.

#### Token effect

The selector adds no messages. A target change may alter interpolated system-prompt text and sends subsequent requests to the selected model.

#### KV Cache effect

Changing provider or model enters that target's cache domain; no cache reuse across distinct targets is assumed.

### Manual skill invocation

#### What the model sees

A `/skill:<name> [instructions]` submission loads the named skill and delivers one text block: a `<skill name="…">` element wrapping the skill's instructions — preceded, when the provider exposes a resource base, by a line locating the skill's relative resources — followed by any trailing instructions the user typed. Delivery follows the same followup-while-idle / steer-while-running rule as ordinary input. The command, not the model, chooses the skill: autocomplete and exact invocation apply `invocation.userInvocable`, while `invocation.modelInvocable` does not restrict this surface. User-disabled skills are omitted from autocomplete and rejected before exact-name loading; the loaded definition is rechecked for a policy race. Autocomplete retains its last complete skill snapshot and refetches after `skills/change`; an incomplete observation preserves the prior menu, a complete empty observation clears it, and a catalog arriving while a slash-name draft is open immediately re-queries that draft. The skill service is an optional peer; this policy check uses its type contract without introducing a runtime package dependency.

#### Token effect

The rendered skill block and trailing instructions are retained as one user turn under the agent loop's normal session-history and compaction rules; a repeated invocation appends the body again.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

### Interactive user-question answers

#### What the model sees

When a consumer calls `ctx.userQuestions.ask()`, this provider presents each question in order and returns selected option labels, `custom` text, or both for a multi-select question. Pending custom text survives switching back to options and joins checked labels on a later options-mode submit. Abort, cancellation, or UI disposal becomes `Error: ask_user_question was interrupted before the user answered` through `dsh-tool-ask-user`.

#### Token effect

Waiting and terminal overlays add no tokens; the resolved answer or error is model-visible only through the calling tool or plugin's result.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Resume has no cross-process session lock** — the selector rejects sessions known to be live in its own runtime, but another process can resume the same persisted id before or during handoff. The all-workspaces scope makes this reachable in one step, since a session another host is driving in a different directory is now selectable. Deployments that can run concurrent hosts must coordinate ownership outside the TUI.
- **One configured session owns the transcript and editor** — questions from other agents can still use the shared overlay provider, but session rendering and prompt input remain bound to `sessionId`.
- **Tool cards are text terminal presentations** — terminal, diff, and generic cards use tool-owned titles/content, but session content currently has no image block for inline image rendering.
- **Non-TTY operation is intentionally unsupported** — app bundles that need automation must compose a one-shot or server front door (`dsh-cli-demo`, `dsh-acp`) rather than expecting an internal fallback.
- **Manual `/skill:` invocation always reloads the full skill body** — the TUI does not detect a skill already present in the conversation, so repeated invocations append its instructions again.
- **File discovery is host-workspace discovery** — autocomplete reads the TUI process's session `cwd`, while the selected text is later interpreted by the configured `read` tool. Deployments that mount a remote or virtual filesystem must keep those namespaces aligned or provide another completion surface.
- **File search uses explicit directory exclusions, not ignore files** — `.git` and `node_modules` are excluded by default and deployments may configure more basenames, but `.gitignore` and `.ignore` are not interpreted. Directory symlinks are not traversed.
